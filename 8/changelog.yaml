        changelog below is from dellemc.enterprise_sonic 2.1.0 and was reverted in
        dellemc.enterprise_sonic 2.2.0, so it is not contained in Ansible 8. For technical
        reasons, this entry is still shown here.

        update your FQCNs for ``community.sap``.
      - The deprecated servicenow.servicenow collection has been removed from Ansible
        7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It will be removed again from Ansible

      - The ngine_io.vultr collection is officially unmaintained and has been archived.
        Therefore, it will be removed from Ansible 9. There is already a successor
        collection ``vultr.cloud`` (using the recent v2 Vultr API) in the community
        package which covers the functionality but might not have compatible syntax
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).
